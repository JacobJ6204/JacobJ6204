**JacobJ6204/JacobJ6204** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I have a little coding experience in Javascript, HTML, and CSS
My parents wanted me too, and I think an understanding and application of computer science could be very useful in the future
Piano, Video Games, Wrestling
I don't have a specific goal for a project, I would like to create something I'm proud of though.
