# Hello

Previous coding experience, if any. 
I have a little coding experience in Javascript, HTML, and CSS

Reasons for taking this class. 
My parents wanted me to, and I think an understanding and application of computer science could be very useful in the future

Other interests (academic or otherwise). 
Piano, Video Games, Wrestling

Goals you have for this class and/or projects you'd like to complete. 
I don't have a specific goal for a project, I would like to create something I'm proud of though.
